# RunORExeriment

Takes as an input a (kinda) standardized OR experiment format.
Performs the experiments, stores the solutions and the performance statistics
for each solver, then generates various performance analysis.

## Features

 - [X] Read experiment description
 - [X] Read instance list
 - [X] Run the experiments
 - [X] Generate primal bounds table
 - [X] Generate average relative percentage deviation tables
 - [ ] Generate Pareto fronts for each instance class
 - [ ] Handle single-point multiple primal algorithms
